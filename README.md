# NX + PHP Demo

> [No code is the best way to write **performant** software. Write nothing, deploy nowhere.](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode)

Currently, large package based PHP projects (like Magento) suffer from long build times. Some of this is due to bad code, some is due to over-allocation to [higher levels of the testing pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html), and some is attributable to the sheer volume of the codebase.

Fortunately, the last problem of "the codebase is large" is a solved problem. Tools like [NX](https://nx.dev/) and [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) leverage topological sorting of the [dependency graph (A directed acyclic graph)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) along with an intelligent build cache to only build, test, lint, and (insert your job here) the particular subgraph of the package graph that has changed.

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js v12+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Nx v13.2.1](https://nx.dev/)
* [PHP v7.4](https://www.php.net/)
* [Composer v2](https://getcomposer.org/)

## Show me the code.

This demo uses `Nx` to highlight what graph-build tools do, and how they can be used with `php`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/damienwebdev/demo-nx-php && cd demo-nx-php 
npx nx dep-graph
```
